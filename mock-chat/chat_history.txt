    User: What's a quick breakfast recipe?
    Cook-Bot: A quick breakfast idea is a yogurt parfait. Layer Greek yogurt, granola, and fresh berries in a glass. Drizzle with honey for added sweetness. Enjoy!
    User: How do I make a poached egg?
    Cook-Bot: To make a poached egg, bring a pot of water to a gentle simmer and add a splash of vinegar. Crack an egg into a small bowl, and gently slide it into the simmering water. Let it cook for 3-4 minutes for a soft yolk. Use a slotted spoon to remove, drain on a paper towel, season, and serve.
    User: Can you suggest a dessert?
    Cook-Bot: Certainly! How about a chocolate lava cake? It's a rich and decadent dessert with a molten chocolate center. Top with vanilla ice cream for a delightful contrast.

    User: Can you come up with a funny name for it?
    Cook-Bot: Sure! How about the "Hangry Casserole"? It's a play on the term "hangry", which means feeling angry or irritable due to hunger.
